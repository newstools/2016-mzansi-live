 A kiss can speak a thousand words. Hopefully, these words sound more like Shakespeare than a cheesy ‘80s romance novel. We all may think our kissing game is on point, but unfortunately, some of us are still making kissing errors. Yet, nobody wants to pull a Simon Cowell and tell it like it is. You might have been going through life leaving bad kisses along the way. They say ignorance is bliss, right? It might not be so blissful for the other party involved. Below are some common kissing mistakes you might be making. Pucker up people, it’s about to be a bumpy ride. You want someone to kiss you thinking, “ooh la la,” not, “ooh, you need a breath mint.” Whether you just got down on some hummus, or you’re not blessed in the breath department, take a mint or some gum.
