 Trick #1: Just ask her! This isn’t even a trick but you would be surprised how often the answer to the following question: “Do you want to come up [over] and hang out for a bit?” is “Sure!” A lot of times all it takes is asking. Some women want to physically escalate but will just not make the first move. Make the first move. Trick #2: “Want to come up to hear me play guitar/see my artwork/etc.” This is my go to method and one of the most successful approaches to getting a woman back to your place. As I mentioned in point number three: many women may be completely comfortable going back to your place just to hook up but they do not want to be judged as so many men. Coming up to hear you play guitar (if you do) or for you to show her something interesting that only exists at your place gives her a great excuse to “save face”.    10 Tips to Turn a Girl On and Make Her Horny 10 Things She (Secretly) Wants You To Try In Bed How to Make Your Girlfriend Want to Have S_ex With You These content links are provided by Content.ad.
