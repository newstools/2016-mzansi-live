 If your relationship sounds anything like this article, it’s time to make a change. You’re too good to settle for anything but the best, save your heart before someone breaks it. Sometimes it can be difficult to read the signs that your relationship is over. Maybe things aren’t as good as they used to be. Perhaps one of you has been unhappy recently and you can’t figure out why. Here are signs that your relationship is over. 1. Who are you? When you first started dating, there was no subject that was off-limits. You and your man could talk all day and all night long. He was your best friend and the person you called multiple times a day. Now, trying to have a conversation with him is worse than having your teeth pulled. You either get ignored, or he resort to one word responses. Chat responses like “yaah”, “k”, “lol”, show distance language, watch out for those and save yourself.
